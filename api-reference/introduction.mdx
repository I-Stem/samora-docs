## Overview

The Samora AI Outbound Call API lets you trigger immediate outbound calls through the Samora AI system. Use it to start calls with your AI agents, pass context via metadata, and retrieve call details including transcripts and recordings.

## Base URL

All requests go to:

```
https://api.samora.ai
```

## Authentication

Every request must include your organization API key in the header:

| Header     | Description                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `X-API-Key` | Your unique organization API key   |

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.samora.ai/v1/call/trigger" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000", "to_number": "+919876543210"}'
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path              | Description                    |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/v1/call/trigger` | [Trigger an outbound call](/api-reference/endpoint/trigger-call)       |
| GET    | `/v1/call/{call_id}` | [Get details for a specific call](/api-reference/endpoint/get-call-details) |

## Phone number format

Destination numbers must be in **E.164** format (e.g. `+919876543210`) and include the country code. The pattern is: `+` followed by 10–15 digits.

## Call statuses

When you fetch call details, `status` can be:

- `PENDING` — Call request created, not yet initiated
- `TRIGGERED` — Call initiated
- `ONGOING` — Call in progress
- `CALL_FINISHED` — Call completed
- `UNANSWERED` — No answer
- `REJECTED` — Call rejected

## Transcripts and recordings

For finished calls, the Get call details response can include:

- **transcript_url** — Presigned URL for the call transcript (valid 60 minutes)
- **recording_url** — Presigned URL for the call recording (valid 60 minutes)
